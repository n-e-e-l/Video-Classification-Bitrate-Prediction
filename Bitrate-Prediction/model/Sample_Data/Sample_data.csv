follow it's advice why don't you go clean up his the stables your insulting riven so what are you going to do about it you're off the team buddy is that clear that one looks good thanks I think we

light of the outcome of this exercise I'd like to say that it was just a test run fair we did all that nothing I wouldn't say for nothing with some of your learnt a lot today was a complete failure

for being taken in by that trick with blues book but however no was a trap and now we are totally powerless for me it's not so bad I've lived my whole life without powers we've got to get them back this is the only way we can solve this mystery I know how we can regain her powers I just say the word null null nobody said the prince guys invitation was false after his Adeline dreamcatchers no visibility ring ring no it is that's telling rain the Sword of power part of the lineal Ride of the princess of the sun and moon of Solaris that means I belongs to you because I can't do that myself this ordering has been in my family will forever yeah but that doesn't tell us why the witches are so eager to have it add letters to Stella but it was really the tricks what a disappointment for Stella the Winx had to give into the witches demands now that sells magic ring is in their possession however the ferry of the sun and moon is safe and the game is over yet there's got to be something in here magical dimension as we know it was created eons ago by the mythical Dragon Force part the secret fire did the Dragon exist for real or is it simply a mythical symbol well I think it represents my dear you know them body made of good vs Evil yeah sure ok could you maybe repeat that in English Stella you must know the story will ancient history is not my strong point of course that princess has different priorities shopping department of logic the trades are common criminals there's gotta be something else to it excuse me I must admit something who are the tricks all that's the name we give her through favourite witches anyhow I discovered other very interesting things about your ring in the book that I found at the library according to the legend of the Sword of Solaris was created a long time ago nobody remembers win it was sculpted out of a stone in Mersey ring of light was still closed today and is only one of the many gifts offered by the great sacred fire that the history of Solaris was ultra very fire exactly excellent question was checking a very pleased you should ask thank you you want to know about the drag well it's quite a long story in the beginning there was nothing then I will the Deep Darkness a dazzling light here it was the great dragon and with his firing breath he created a multitude of different world and spread life light and heat across the universe eventually the Dragon became exhausted and I'd like to know more about this dragon I think I'll go back to the library there still too many questions left unanswered love you for some reason I don't think the Dragon is just the legend there's something more to this story something imported I can just feel it can help you come with me unrest in a place called domino unfriendly play now it is but it used to be a happy and prosperous place before dark forces attacked domino and put the dragons flame once and for all the magical dimension hasn't been the same since wow tell me Bloom why are you so interested in the Dragon I don't know I guess I'm just curious everything can you offer me here yes I can understand that well I'll leave now thank you I just want to get my ring back yeah and I think we should be the ones attack tap now or not soldiers how can we overpower icy Darcy and stormy by taken by surprise no explosion I'm going back to bed now it test free stupid
